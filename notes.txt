# Types of display elements in html

- Block Element
    Takes up the entire line

- Inline-block Element
    Takes only as much spase as needed

- Inline Element
    Appears within a line of text


# Nested layout Techniques

- Vertical Layout
    Items are on Top of each other 

- Horizontal Layout
    Items are besides each other

- Grid Layout
    Layout with rows and columns
    
- Flex Layout
    Elements inside Flex behave more like Inline-block instead of block elements

- CSS positions
    To make an element placed/positioned:
    Absoloute, i.e. with respect to the page if not in a relative positioned element
    Relative, i.e. with respect to the outer element
    OR
    Static, i.e. default position
    Fixed, i.e. placed with respect to the browser window
